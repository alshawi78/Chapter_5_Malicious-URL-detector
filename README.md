# Chapter_5_Malicious-URL-detector
The idea behind this code is that we have the following 

1- malicious URL database 

2- None malicious URL database

3- Anonymous URL that need to be veryfied 

The code will compaire URLs to both databases to find out if it is malicious or not. We use the Append code to add URLs that is not known if they are malicious or not to the termprary file which we will call anonymous URLs.
